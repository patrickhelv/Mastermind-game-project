# Mastermind-game-project
Mastermind game made for a course TDT4102 - Prosedyre- og objektorientert programmering. 
If you start the program you will get a terminal and a graphic window. 
You can input a 4 letter guess in the input field. You have to guess a code A-F and there could be multiple occurences of the same letter. 
Each time you guess a code, you will get information if the letter is in the code and if your guessed code is in the right position.

## Dependencies
- FLTK
- GraphLib
- C 11

## How to Run the program
- You can run the release .exe file. 
- If you are on windows you can run the file by double clicking on it.

## What if you want to run it locally ?
- To configure to run C++ is difficult, and you need to include dependencies. 
- Go over to this project https://github.com/patrickhelv/Run-cpp-code-TDT4102 and download the dependencies. Follow the instructions on that Github page.
